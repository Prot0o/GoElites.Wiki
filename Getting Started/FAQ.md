*Here is a collection of questions that staff and helpful members get asked on daily basis. They are not troubleshooting-related so there are very few reliable sources where answers to these questions can be found. We will try to give comprehensive answers to most of them here!*

### How different is GoElites from other services out there?

In GoElites, our greatest value is your experience as our community member. We strive to provide the best service on the market by supplying you with easy to setup yet exceptionally efficient software and quick yet professional troubleshooting support in case something goes wrong. You're also able to easily get in touch with other like-minded people in our community and find partners to play or even build friendship with. Regardless of what you're willing to do on GoElites (within boundaries set in Community Guidelines above), we will do our best to make it worthwhile!
### Can I use your software on my device?

Our software can currently only be ran on devices with Windows 7 or higher installed (and which support .NET Framework 4).

### Can I help?

Yes. If you come across someone who has encountered a problem you know how to solve - help him out! Also, if you feel like we lack people who speak your language in our team which allows some violations to stay unnoticed - please reach us out and tell about it. If you are known as helpful and trustworthy member of our community - you'll be able to join our support team.

### Will you release an API so other developers can release their scripts?

No such plans for now!

### Is there any certain order for champion script releases? What champions should we expect next?

First we port OKTW champions, then we will start a poll. Champions are ported in accordance with the demand. 

### Is there any way to play using GoElites as a free user?

As of now there is no.
